## CodeTypeService

The `CodeTypeService` and its implementation `CodeTypeServiceImpl` manage different types of codes used within the system. This service is essential for handling various code-related operations, ensuring that the system can efficiently manage and utilize different code types.

## BroadleafSitemapUtils

The `BroadleafSitemapUtils` provides utility functions for handling sitemaps. This service is crucial for generating and managing sitemaps, which are essential for search engine optimization (SEO) and improving the discoverability of the website's content.

## <SwmToken path="core/broadleaf-framework/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/core/util/service/ResourcePurgeServiceImpl.java" pos="49:12:12" line-data="import org.broadleafcommerce.core.order.service.OrderService;">`OrderService`</SwmToken>

The <SwmToken path="core/broadleaf-framework/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/core/util/service/ResourcePurgeServiceImpl.java" pos="49:12:12" line-data="import org.broadleafcommerce.core.order.service.OrderService;">`OrderService`</SwmToken> is an example of a service that provides operations related to orders, such as creating, updating, and retrieving orders. This service is integral to the e-commerce functionality of the Broadleaf Commerce framework.

## <SwmToken path="core/broadleaf-framework/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/core/util/service/ResourcePurgeServiceImpl.java" pos="56:12:12" line-data="import org.broadleafcommerce.profile.core.service.CustomerService;">`CustomerService`</SwmToken>

The <SwmToken path="core/broadleaf-framework/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/core/util/service/ResourcePurgeServiceImpl.java" pos="56:12:12" line-data="import org.broadleafcommerce.profile.core.service.CustomerService;">`CustomerService`</SwmToken> provides functionalities related to customer management. It is injected into the <SwmToken path="core/broadleaf-framework/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/core/util/service/ResourcePurgeServiceImpl.java" pos="103:4:4" line-data="public class ResourcePurgeServiceImpl implements ResourcePurgeService {">`ResourcePurgeServiceImpl`</SwmToken> class using the <SwmToken path="core/broadleaf-framework/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/core/util/service/ResourcePurgeServiceImpl.java" pos="113:1:2" line-data="    @Resource(name = &quot;blTransactionManager&quot;)">`@Resource`</SwmToken> annotation, demonstrating how different services can be integrated and utilized within the framework.
