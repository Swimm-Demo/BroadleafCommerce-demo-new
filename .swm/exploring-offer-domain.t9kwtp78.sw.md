# Exploring Offer Domain

The domain in the Offer package refers to the set of classes and interfaces that define the core business logic and data structures for handling offers in the system. These classes include <SwmToken path="core/broadleaf-framework/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/core/offer/domain/OfferInfo.java" pos="18:8:8" line-data="package org.broadleafcommerce.core.offer.domain;">`offer`</SwmToken>, `OfferRule`, <SwmToken path="core/broadleaf-framework/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/core/offer/domain/OfferInfo.java" pos="25:4:4" line-data="public interface OfferInfo extends Serializable, MultiTenantCloneable&lt;OfferInfo&gt;{">`OfferInfo`</SwmToken>, and others, which encapsulate the properties and behaviors of different types of offers, such as discounts and promotions.

# Domain Classes

The domain classes are responsible for defining how offers are created, managed, and applied to orders, items, and customers. For example, the `OfferRuleImpl` class implements the `OfferRule` interface and contains the logic for matching rules that determine when an offer is applicable.

The <SwmToken path="core/broadleaf-framework/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/core/offer/domain/OfferInfo.java" pos="25:4:4" line-data="public interface OfferInfo extends Serializable, MultiTenantCloneable&lt;OfferInfo&gt;{">`OfferInfo`</SwmToken> class is part of the domain package and includes necessary imports for multi-tenancy support.

```java
package org.broadleafcommerce.core.offer.domain;

import org.broadleafcommerce.common.copy.MultiTenantCloneable;
```

# Multi-Tenancy Support

Domain classes often implement interfaces like <SwmToken path="core/broadleaf-framework/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/core/offer/domain/OfferInfo.java" pos="20:10:10" line-data="import org.broadleafcommerce.common.copy.MultiTenantCloneable;">`MultiTenantCloneable`</SwmToken> to support multi-tenancy and cloning capabilities, ensuring that offers can be replicated across different tenants in a multi-tenant environment.

# Main Functions

There are several main functions in this folder. Some of them are <SwmToken path="core/broadleaf-framework/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/core/offer/domain/OfferInfo.java" pos="18:8:8" line-data="package org.broadleafcommerce.core.offer.domain;">`offer`</SwmToken>, `OfferRule`, <SwmToken path="core/broadleaf-framework/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/core/offer/domain/OfferInfo.java" pos="25:4:4" line-data="public interface OfferInfo extends Serializable, MultiTenantCloneable&lt;OfferInfo&gt;{">`OfferInfo`</SwmToken>, and others. We will dive a little into <SwmToken path="core/broadleaf-framework/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/core/offer/domain/OfferInfo.java" pos="18:8:8" line-data="package org.broadleafcommerce.core.offer.domain;">`offer`</SwmToken> and `OfferRule`.

## Offer

The <SwmToken path="core/broadleaf-framework/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/core/offer/domain/OfferInfo.java" pos="18:8:8" line-data="package org.broadleafcommerce.core.offer.domain;">`offer`</SwmToken> class encapsulates the properties and behaviors of different types of offers, such as discounts and promotions. It defines how offers are created, managed, and applied to orders, items, and customers.

## OfferRule

The `OfferRule` interface and its implementation `OfferRuleImpl` contain the logic for matching rules that determine when an offer is applicable. This is crucial for applying the correct offers based on specific conditions.
