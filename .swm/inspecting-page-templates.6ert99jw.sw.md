# [Retrieving Field Groups](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBQnJvYWRsZWFmQ29tbWVyY2UtZGVtby1uZXclM0ElM0FTd2ltbS1EZW1v/docs/exmrhulk#getfieldgroups)

The process begins by retrieving the field groups associated with a page template. Field groups are collections of fields that are logically grouped together. These groups are essential for organizing the fields within a page template, making it easier to manage and understand the structure of the template. For example, a field group might contain all the fields related to the header section of a webpage.

# [Adding or Updating Entities](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBQnJvYWRsZWFmQ29tbWVyY2UtZGVtby1uZXclM0ElM0FTd2ltbS1EZW1v/docs/exmrhulk#addorupdate)

Once the field groups are retrieved, the next step is to add or update the entities. This involves validating the entity to ensure all required fields are correctly filled out and updating the page fields as necessary. This step ensures that any changes made to the page template are correctly saved and reflected in the system. For instance, if a new field is added to the template, this step will ensure that the field is properly integrated and stored.

# [Constructing Dynamic Properties](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBQnJvYWRsZWFmQ29tbWVyY2UtZGVtby1uZXclM0ElM0FTd2ltbS1EZW1v/docs/exmrhulk#builddynamicpropertylist)

The final step is constructing dynamic properties from the field groups. Dynamic properties are metadata attributes that describe the fields within a page template. This step involves creating properties for each field, including an ID property to ensure proper identification. These properties are then used to dynamically generate metadata for the page template, making it easier to manage and customize the template. For example, a dynamic property might include the field type, length, and whether the field is required.
