# Understanding Image Filter

Filters are components used to apply various image effects in a chain. They are part of the image processing pipeline and are used to modify images by applying operations such as resizing, rotating, altering colors, and sharpening. Each filter performs a specific operation on the image, and multiple filters can be chained together to achieve complex image transformations.

# <SwmToken path="admin/broadleaf-open-admin-platform/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/openadmin/server/service/artifact/image/effects/chain/filter/BaseFilter.java" pos="31:6:6" line-data="public abstract class BaseFilter implements BufferedImageOp, OperationBuilder {">`BaseFilter`</SwmToken> Class

The <SwmToken path="admin/broadleaf-open-admin-platform/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/openadmin/server/service/artifact/image/effects/chain/filter/BaseFilter.java" pos="31:6:6" line-data="public abstract class BaseFilter implements BufferedImageOp, OperationBuilder {">`BaseFilter`</SwmToken> class provides common functionality for all filters, including methods to check if specific filter parameters are present. This class is essential for ensuring that all filters have a consistent interface and can be easily managed within the image processing pipeline.

# Filter Implementations

Filters like `Resize`, `Rotate`, `AlterRGB`, and `UnsharpMask` are implemented to handle different types of image modifications. Each of these filters performs a specific transformation on the image, allowing for a wide range of effects to be applied.

# Filter Package

Filters are defined in the package <SwmToken path="admin/broadleaf-open-admin-platform/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/openadmin/server/service/artifact/image/effects/chain/filter/BaseFilter.java" pos="18:2:20" line-data="package org.broadleafcommerce.openadmin.server.service.artifact.image.effects.chain.filter;">`org.broadleafcommerce.openadmin.server.service.artifact.image.effects.chain.filter`</SwmToken>. This package contains all the classes and interfaces necessary for implementing and managing image filters.

# Main Functions

There are several main functions in this folder.
