# Overview

The pricing workflow in Broadleaf Commerce involves a series of activities and processes to determine the final price of an order. This includes calculating item prices, applying discounts, computing taxes, and determining fulfillment costs.

# Fulfillment Item Pricing

The `FulfillmentItemPricingActivity` is responsible for setting each item's merchandise total and taxable total during the pricing workflow. It ensures that the total price for each item is accurately calculated and any necessary adjustments are made.

# Fulfillment Group Pricing

The <SwmToken path="core/broadleaf-framework/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/core/pricing/service/workflow/FulfillmentGroupPricingActivity.java" pos="42:4:4" line-data="public class FulfillmentGroupPricingActivity extends BaseActivity&lt;ProcessContext&lt;Order&gt;&gt; {">`FulfillmentGroupPricingActivity`</SwmToken> computes all fulfillment costs for the fulfillment groups on an order. It updates the order with the total price of all fulfillment groups, ensuring that shipping and handling costs are accurately reflected.

The <SwmToken path="core/broadleaf-framework/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/core/pricing/service/workflow/FulfillmentGroupPricingActivity.java" pos="58:8:8" line-data="    public ProcessContext&lt;Order&gt; execute(ProcessContext&lt;Order&gt; context) throws Exception {">`execute`</SwmToken> function processes the fulfillment groups in an order to compute their fulfillment costs. It iterates through each fulfillment group, calculates the cost using the <SwmToken path="core/broadleaf-framework/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/core/pricing/service/workflow/FulfillmentGroupPricingActivity.java" pos="71:5:5" line-data="                    fulfillmentGroup = fulfillmentPricingService.calculateCostForFulfillmentGroup(fulfillmentGroup);">`fulfillmentPricingService`</SwmToken>, and updates the order with the total fulfillment charges.

```java
    @Override
    public ProcessContext<Order> execute(ProcessContext<Order> context) throws Exception {
        Order order = context.getSeedData();

        /*
         * 1. Get FGs from Order
         * 2. take each FG and call shipping module with the shipping svc
         * 3. add FG back to order
         */

        Money totalFulfillmentCharges = BroadleafCurrencyUtils.getMoney(BigDecimal.ZERO, order.getCurrency());
        for (FulfillmentGroup fulfillmentGroup : order.getFulfillmentGroups()) {
            if (fulfillmentGroup != null) {

                    totalFulfillmentCharges = totalFulfillmentCharges.add(fulfillmentGroup.getFulfillmentPrice());
                }

# Creating the Process Context

The <SwmToken path="core/broadleaf-framework/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/core/pricing/service/workflow/PricingProcessContextFactory.java" pos="26:4:4" line-data="public class PricingProcessContextFactory implements ProcessContextFactory&lt;Order, Order&gt; {">`PricingProcessContextFactory`</SwmToken> creates the context required for the pricing workflow. It initializes the process context with the order data, allowing the workflow activities to access and modify the order as needed.

<SwmSnippet path="/core/broadleaf-framework/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/core/pricing/service/workflow/PricingProcessContextFactory.java" line="26">

The `createProcessContext` function initializes the process context with the order data. This context is used by the workflow activities to access and modify the order as needed.

```java
public class PricingProcessContextFactory implements ProcessContextFactory<Order, Order> {
```

# Calculating the Total Price

The `TotalActivity` calculates the total price of the order, including all items, discounts, taxes, and fulfillment costs. It ensures that the final order total is accurate and reflects all pricing components.

# Main Functions
