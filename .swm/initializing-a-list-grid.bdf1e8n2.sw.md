# [Setting up the List Grid](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBQnJvYWRsZWFmQ29tbWVyY2UtZGVtby1uZXclM0ElM0FTd2ltbS1EZW1v/docs/fqdkze10#initializing-the-list-grid)

The process begins by setting up the list grid. This involves adjusting the table size to ensure it fits within the container and is ready for infinite scrolling. The table's dimensions are fine-tuned to account for scrollbars and other UI elements, ensuring a seamless user experience. This step is crucial for making sure the grid is visually appealing and functional.

# [Configuring Infinite Scrolling](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBQnJvYWRsZWFmQ29tbWVyY2UtZGVtby1uZXclM0ElM0FTd2ltbS1EZW1v/docs/fqdkze10#setting-up-infinite-scrolling)

Infinite scrolling is configured to enhance the user experience by allowing more records to load as the user scrolls down. This involves setting up a custom scrollbar and binding events that trigger the loading of additional records. The goal is to provide a smooth and continuous scrolling experience without the need for pagination.

# [Loading Records](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBQnJvYWRsZWFmQ29tbWVyY2UtZGVtby1uZXclM0ElM0FTd2ltbS1EZW1v/docs/fqdkze10#loading-records)

Loading records into the list grid is a critical step. It starts by acquiring a lock to ensure that only one load operation is performed at a time. This prevents multiple load operations from interfering with each other. The system then checks if the list grid is visible before proceeding. If the grid is not visible, the load operation is aborted to save resources.

# [Determining Record Range](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBQnJvYWRsZWFmQ29tbWVyY2UtZGVtby1uZXclM0ElM0FTd2ltbS1EZW1v/docs/fqdkze10#determining-record-range)

The range of records to load is determined based on the visible viewport and the already loaded ranges. This ensures that only the necessary records are loaded, optimizing performance. The system calculates the start and end indices of the records to be loaded, considering the current scroll position and the total number of records available.

# [Making AJAX Calls](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBQnJvYWRsZWFmQ29tbWVyY2UtZGVtby1uZXclM0ElM0FTd2ltbS1EZW1v/docs/fqdkze10#making-ajax-calls)

AJAX calls are made to fetch data from the server. These calls are configured to include necessary parameters and handle security tokens. The server response is processed to ensure the data is correctly handled and displayed in the list grid. This step is essential for dynamically loading data as the user interacts with the grid.

# [Handling AJAX Responses](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBQnJvYWRsZWFmQ29tbWVyY2UtZGVtby1uZXclM0ElM0FTd2ltbS1EZW1v/docs/fqdkze10#handling-ajax-responses)

The server response from the AJAX call is processed to ensure the data is correctly handled. Internal data handlers are run, analytics are tracked, and the provided callback is invoked. This ensures that the data is correctly displayed in the list grid and any additional processing is performed.
